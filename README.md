# Change 1
I added a CSS style to my website. At first, I had the style in the HTML file, but I found out that was not the right way to do it. So, I created an external CSS file and linked it in all the HTML files (W3Schools, 2025a).

# Change 2
To make the website feel more alive, I added a video. Yes, we didn’t strictly need it, but it enhances the visual appeal. I embedded the video element and placed comments beneath it from users who posted on it (W3Schools, 2025b; W3Schools, 2025c).

# Change 3
I added a welcoming audio track that users can pause and play at will. This audio gives more information about The Greater Hunt’s website. I also included a slider (seek bar) so users can choose where to listen from (W3Schools, 2025d; W3Schools, 2025e).

# Change 4
I noticed that the product items were positioned awkwardly, so I adjusted their layout so they display side by side. This improves the page’s aesthetics, and when switching from phone to tablet, the products rearrange responsively (W3Schools, 2025f; W3Schools, 2025g).

# Change 5
I implemented responsive design techniques so the website automatically resizes for tablets and smartphones. This improves cross-platform viewing and usability (W3Schools, 2025h; W3Schools, 2025i).
