Change 1
I added a CSS style to my website. At first, I had the style in the HTML file, but I found out that was not the right way to do it. So, I added a CSS file and linked it to all the HTML files.

Change 2
To make the website feel more alive, I added a video. Yes, I know we didn’t need to do it, but it does make the website better to look at. I added the video, and under it I put comments from the people who posted on it.

Change 3
I added a welcoming sound that you can pause and play whenever you like. This will tell you more about The Greater Hunt’s website. I also added a slider to control where you want to listen from.

Change 4
I noticed that the way the products were placed looked a bit weird, so I made the products show side by side. This makes the webpage look better, and when switching from phone to tablet, the products will display differently.

Change 5
I added a way for the website to automatically resize for tablets and smartphones. This helps with cross-platform viewing.

Change 6

I also added a facebook and instagram icone so that people that want to subscribe to them can do so
